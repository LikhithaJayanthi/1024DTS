Problem Definition: 
Finding out strategic solutions for leveraging Yelpâ€™s community and user engagement for upscaling their businesses.

Prescription for Yelp:
Based on all the above insights here's a prescription for Yelp to enhance its platform and user experience:
1. Quality Over Quantity:
   Focus on promoting quality and engagement within business categories rather than encouraging businesses to list under multiple categories. Prioritize businesses that receive consistent positive reviews and engage effectively with customers.
2. Review-Boosting Initiatives:
   Launch campaigns to encourage more user reviews, as higher review counts tend to correlate with better ratings. Promote features that incentivize users to provide constructive and genuine feedback, fostering an ecosystem of reliable reviews.
3. Customized Recommendations:
   Utilize insights from review ratings, categories, and user behaviors to fine-tune recommendation algorithms. Deliver more personalized suggestions to users, leading them to businesses that match their preferences and local trends.
4. Engagement During Night Hours:
   Explore strategies to encourage user engagement and reviews during nighttime hours. Consider implementing night-time promotions or incentives to capitalize on this time frame, even though it doesn't strongly influence ratings.
5. Elite User Empowerment:
   Leverage the moderate correlation between elite count and number of friends. Introduce features that enhance interactions and networking among elite users, fostering a sense of community and shared experiences.
6. Community Partnerships:
   Collaborate with top-reviewed businesses and high-engagement states to foster economic growth and community development. Recognize and support businesses that contribute significantly to the platform's success.
7. Sentiment Analysis Integration:
   Integrate sentiment analysis tools to evaluate review sentiments on a larger scale. Highlight businesses with consistently positive sentiment scores to attract users seeking highly-rated venues.
8. Seasonal Promotions:
   Leverage trends from user engagement and review counts to launch seasonal promotions or events. Offer incentives for users to engage with the platform during peak periods, fostering increased reviews and interactions.
9. User Engagement Insights:
   Continuously monitor user engagement metrics, including reviews, check-ins, and user interactions. Use this data to refine algorithms, personalize user experiences, and guide platform improvements.
10. User Education and Empowerment:
   Educate business owners on factors influencing review counts, ratings, and user engagement. Provide resources and guidance on how to effectively manage their Yelp profiles to maximize positive customer experiences.


Recommendations for Yelp Business and Marketing Department

Red Flag 1 : Only 19 users out of 1987896 (almost 2 million users) who give the highest numbers of compliments. This is significantly low. 
Something is wrong in the business process map for why the community is less engaged. 

Red Flag 2 : if the dataset is erroneous or biased, this itself is a problem for Yelp because one revenue stream of Yelp is selling data. 
If they sell doubtful data to businesses, they might have to face challenges in terms of that.


1. Reviews are important driving force
for yelp. Yelp should initiate a program
for making sure that enough reviews
are coming from businesses. There has to be a 
linear growth in the number of categories of a 
business and the number of reviews recieved. 

Proper partnerships with the businesses along 
with terms and conditions for connecting 
with yelp users and bringing in marketing
campaigns to drive the users to write reviews 
is necessary. Business entities need to be responsible 
for this mutual engagement too. 

2. Investigations into the average review ratings
for businesses with high review or low review or 
for example night time checkins are almost similar.

Usually with higher reviews, having an average
review is expected but Yelp needs to sit with 
the businesses who have lower review counts in 
their page and investigate why it is happening and 
take proper steps. 

3. Better recommendation systems should be 
introduced in terms of human networking. Because
the correlation between the Elite count and 
their number of friends are low. This correlation
is important to be higher for Yelp because, 
Yelp needs more community leaders (Elites) for pushing
the brand move forward. So new Elites are important 
to grow in numbers. Yelp needs to plan the system
accordingly

4. State wise engagement and marketing plan should 
look further to see why reviews are significantly low from 
some states and the marketing department should start the campaigns
targetting those states. 


By implementing these strategies and leveraging the insights gained, Yelp can create a more engaging and dynamic platform that caters to user preferences, encourages meaningful interactions, and supports businesses in delivering exceptional services to their customers.
