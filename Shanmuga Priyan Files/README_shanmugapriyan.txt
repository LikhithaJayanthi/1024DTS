Major Activities performed in this Project:

In this project, I explored the Yelp dataset to gain insights into its structure and data fields. 
I utilized Kaggle as a platform to further explore and visualize the dataset using its online notebook. 
I employed SQL queries to extract valuable insights from the data, including tasks like filtering and aggregation. 
Additionally, I performed 3 Spark jobs on GCP Dataproc for scalable data processing and analysis, though faced some challenges in executing MapReduce jobs. 
Furthermore, I imported the dataset into Tableau, where I crafted visualizations to effectively represent the insights gathered and offer valuable insights for potential business strategies.
