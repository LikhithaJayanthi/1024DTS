Mahmood's project works : 
1. Exploratory data analysis and transformation
2. 1 Spark Job to find out and insights against hypothesis
3. 1 Mapreduce job
4. Mid Term Presentation
5. Yelp ERD and Business Process Map


I have started with exploring the dataset, loaded into SQlite database and pinpointed to work with Business, Checkin and User datasets. 
Then I have created some new features for the datasets and ran analysis against my hypothesis. 
I have ran the Sparkjob and MapReduce files on Google Dataproc. 
Along with these, I have created the midpoint presentation as well.
