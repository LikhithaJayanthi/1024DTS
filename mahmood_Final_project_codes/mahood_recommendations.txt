Recommendations for Yelp

1. Reviews are important driving force
for yelp. Yelp should initiate a program
for making sure that enough reviews
are coming from businesses. There has to be a 
linear growth in the number of categories of a 
business and the number of reviews recieved. 

Proper partnerships with the businesses along 
with terms and conditions for connecting 
with yelp users and bringing in marketing
campaigns to drive the users to write reviews 
is necessary. Business entities need to be responsible 
for this mutual engagement too. 

2. Investigations into the average review ratings
for businesses with high review or low review or 
for example night time checkins are almost similar.

Usually with higher reviews, having an average
review is expected but Yelp needs to sit with 
the businesses who have lower review counts in 
their page and investigate why it is happening and 
take proper steps. 

3. Better recommendation systems should be 
introduced in terms of human networking. Because
the correlation between the Elite count and 
their number of friends are low. This correlation
is important to be higher for Yelp because, 
Yelp needs more community leaders (Elites) for pushing
the brand move forward. So new Elites are important 
to grow in numbers. Yelp needs to plan the system
accordingly

4. State wise engagement and marketing plan should 
look further to see why reviews are significantly low from 
some states and the marketing department should start the campaigns
targetting those states.
